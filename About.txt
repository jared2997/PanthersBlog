Hello My name is Jared Thompson. I am a long time Panthers fan and I've decided to write some articles about my favorite NFL Team and more. I am also a web developer and I've designed and coded up this blog you are currently reading. I am 19 years old and live in Arizona. One of my first football games I watched was Cam Newton's first NFL game in Carolina against the Jaguars. And ever since that game, I became a Panthers fan and have sticked around since then. Through the ups and downs, this team will still be my favorite team in the NFL.
